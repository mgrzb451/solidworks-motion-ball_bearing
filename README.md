# Ball Bearing Animation

I wanted to explore and understand the different types of Mates in Solidworks Assembly and came up with an idea of animating a ball bearing. That was fun! ðŸ˜€

I do wish I had a stronger PC to be able to render some animations in Solidworks Visualize though. Grilling my PC for 4h for a 5sec clip is too much â˜¹
